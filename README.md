# Stock Market Analysis & Prediction using LSTM 📈🧠

This project demonstrates how to analyze and predict stock market prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It leverages historical data of technology stocks (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN) obtained from Yahoo Finance.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Fetches stock price data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Prepares time-series data for supervised learning
- Builds and trains an LSTM model using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`
- Predicts and visualizes future stock closing prices

---

## 📊 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas, NumPy
- yfinance, pandas_datareader
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
